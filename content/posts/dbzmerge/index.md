This is a webpage based on the [project's original document.](https://jysze.github.io/SoM-DBZ-Merge/mergeproject/R1R2.pdf)

This project is one of the bigs [Seed of Might's improvements to the raw footage from the Dragon Box DVD sets](https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=%22%5BSoM%5D%22+Dragon+Box+%7C+DBox&s=size&o=desc) due to the lack of quality official releases. We've created an innovative multi-sourced video track, getting the best out of both Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box releases: the Japanese (Region 2 - 2003) and the American one (Region 1 - 2011).

# Video

This is not a purist project. For those seeking this kind of release,
there are already remuxes and encoded batches with less modifications to
the image available for download like [this one](https://nyaa.si/view/1114198).

Purism is collectively understood as "you don't fuck it up if you don't
touch it." It is an important and safe attitude that keeps decent
sources from disappearing and helps people get more critical of poorly
made edits and filterings.

However, purism for the sake of purism can sometimes be limiting. With
that in mind, the intention of this release was to improve upon the
Dragon Boxes by not only reducing or eliminating flaws in the source
material, but also combining the strengths of each release together in a
attempt to make the video look more like the original Dragon Box
masters. Rest assured that this will not be some blue-tinted
*warpsharped* mess, but rather a pretty based release that is quite
unlike anything you have ever seen before.

Criticism is welcome, by the way!

Both R1 and R2J are 720 x 480 resolution, which you might think looks
horizontally stretched, but they come with a flag that instructs the
intended display to resize it to how it should actually look. This flag
is something called a pixel aspect ratio, or PAR. It can be confusing to
wrap your head around, but the basic idea is that it tells the display
that each pixel in the 720 x 480 resolution should be taller than it is
wide by a set amount. This will accurately resize the image and make it
look as it should. This PAR transformation plus overscan from a CRT
television (the intended display) yields a 4:3 picture (the display
aspect ratio, or "DAR"). Today though, we don't use CRTs and so some
decisions have to be made about how to resize accurately. One thing is
clear: it is not possible to have a 4:3 DAR and the correct PAR without
cropping. So we are left with 3 options.

-   Prioritize a 4:3 DAR at all costs without cropping. This leads to an
    incorrect PAR and so the image will look vertically stretched
    compared to what is intended.

-   Prioritize the correct PAR without cropping. This leads to a picture
    that looks correct but is wider than 4:3 and will sometimes show
    part of the image that is not meant to be shown (e.g. inconsistent
    and blurred black bars), since DVD authoring always predicts
    overscan by the old CRTs.

-   Prioritize the correct PAR and a 4:3 DAR, which is achieved by
    cropping away the overscanned part. This results in resolutions such
    as 708 x 480 (which is resized to 708 x 531 on most players after
    the PAR transformation).

This project uses the third option.

## Pixel aspect ratio

Non-square pixels were supposedly a smart choice at the time. The
standard was analog display that could pack more information
horizontally than vertically given any square sample of it. The industry
had to optimize the data on DVDs for the consumer end, so this
mathematical pixel concept that can only be approximated by modern
players made sense in the past.

If you search right now for PAR correction on DVD footage, you will
probably get to 10:11, both on simple and very detailed explanations on
CRT analog-to-digital, signal-to-pixel conversions. But this is not the
ratio we are using (160:177).

Another wrong PAR is 8:9, which comes from the resolution standard first
set to DVDs fitted on a 4:3 DAR, which has nothing to do with how CRTs
were using the converted signal to display a 4:3 footage. A couple of
standards were written to fix the squeezed DVD footage. These standards
were *digital* standards, to match the digital display of the video to
what a well-calibrated CRT already would correctly display. Thus it's a
conversion standard. From 8:9 to whatever gives the correct image. It's
a complicated matter and the numbers get pretty ugly. Even the nice
recommended 10:11 ratio is actually an approximation to 38800:42651 ([read more](https://encodingwissen.de/hintergrund/videobild/anamorph/itu-r-bt601/)).

The 160:177 PAR standard comes from [SMPTE RP 187-1995](https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.RP187.1995) and
supposedly solved the rectangle pixel issue for good. The industry
ignores it nonetheless, because the numbers they came up with were
awfully obnoxious and even the scaling process would be more
hardware-expensive. This explains why this standard is not as well-known
as the 10:11 one. But here in 20's, scaling video is not a problem, and
your player will scale the footage like it is nothing.

We have tested it, and 160:177 looks best overall on Dragon Box.
Meticulous comparisons using circle objects in the video (like the
dragon ball at the very beginning of each episode) didn't give a huge
edge to 160:177 over 10:11 because the film itself always has some form
of warping. However, it's also better to be safe than sorry. Having a
4:3, 160:177 PAR footage leaves it with 4 extra pixel columns compared
to a 4:3 with 10:11 PAR. You can still crop them alway and set the PAR
to 10:11 if you want, which is not possible to do the other way around.

We refer to [the lurker's guide to video](https://lurkertech.com/lg/video-systems/#pixelaspect) for more detail on pixel
aspect ratio.

## About the merging of the R1 and R2J footage

This merge of the two Dragon Boxes aims to get more detail at the
boundary ranges of luma in order to obtain a higher dynamic range in a
natural manner, without artificially warping/crushing the luma using
sigmoid-esque functions. This is made possible due to the brightness
difference between the North American NTSC and Japanese NTSC-J standards
and how the DVD compression codec (MPEG-2) handles this difference.
Basically, MPEG-2 gives more bitrate to brighter areas. Darker areas get
less bitrate and so the image details there are blurrier and often
destroyed. Fortunately for us, the North American NTSC standard has
brighter blacks compared to NTSC-J, which means that MPEG-2 was able to
allocate more bitrate to the dark areas on the R1 Dragon Box compared to
the R2J, even though the latter has a higher overall bitrate. In
addition to better dark details, the R1 Dragon Box also has more dark
details. This is because DVDs have a limited luma range, and the
brighter blacks on the R1 allowed more dark details to pass through that
limited range. These same extra details missed the cut on R2J and were
clipped away instead. So what does all this mean? It means that the R1
Dragon Box has better preserved dark details while the R2J Dragon Box
has better preserved mid-and-bright details.

And now with the merge, we can combine the best of both worlds in order
to obtain an image quality that is superior to either source on its own.
We believe that this merged release is a much closer representation of
what the Dragon Box masters look like. Get ready to experience a level
of detail and dynamic range that has not been seen before from the
Dragon Box.

One thing to note is that the detail difference between R1 and R2J can
vary. This means that while some shots will show a profound improvement
in the merge, others may only reveal a subtle difference. The figure
below exemplifies the general differences between R1 and R2J with their
mid tones matched. R2J is clearly sharper compared to R1, yet R1 has
contours in dark areas which are not as evident in R2J.

![Comparison between R1 and R2J dragon boxes](img/merge/R1xR2J.webp)

## Blocking treatment

R2J has a lot of compression in its grain in the form of flat
macroblocks with constant luma values, inside of which there is no
relevant information whatsoever. In digital footage with little noise,
smoothing away macroblocks blends well with the rest of the footage, but
that is not the case with footage filled with film grain.

As a better approach to this type of video image, we filled these
compressed areas with grain based on the grain of the footage to make it
more uniform and pleasant to watch, again bringing the watching
experience closer to what watching the SD masters would be. For the
areas where there is already grain (with no significant compression) and
detail, the image left untouched, thus preserving every bit of detail of
the raw merged video.

Another important thing we did is to restrict the strength of the grain
applied on the flat blocks in order to ensure that we are not *visually*
destroying the existing detail. This prevents subtle details from being
less perceptible when neighboured by noise with high variance. The
result is a natural-looking, grain-preserving compression cleaning.

![Grain normalization](img/merge/grain.webp)


## Chroma treatment

Sadly, we cannot give chroma the same noise treatment. The luma noise
has a certain amount of detail allowing it to be kept and enhanced. The
chroma channels, on the other hand, are half the resolution of luma and
have far more compression. What would otherwise be fine color noise from
the film is just broken phagocytized blobs of compression that only help
in making the footage unappealing. They had to go.

![CCD showcase](img/merge/ccd.webp)


Another major problem with the video source is chromatic aberration. It
is pretty strong in some episodes. Regular filters usually do not work
well in this case and most of them have unacceptable drawbacks. Our
solution will clean it almost completely, but sometimes soften the
chroma channels where chroma aberration is detected. We made sure to
mitigate this issue by further improving condition masks and calibrating
the strength of our script to balance the softness and aberration to our
liking.

![Chromatic aberration removal](img/merge/chromatic_aberration.webp)

Finally, one might ask if there were changes in colors or any form of
color-correction. We did not do any sort of color-correction for this
release. Some of the episodes will look less tinted on this release
compared to R2J, but there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, the
clipped dark tones in R2J makes the dark tint relatively more visible
even with the same chroma channels. Secondly, some R1 episodes just
randomly have less of a tint, perhaps because Toei Animation messed up
those episodes for the R2J, and chroma from R1 is used in this project.
Anyone developing a scene-by-scene white-balance project for R2J should
not worry though, since R1's ocasionnal lower tint is probably on the
whole episode or chapter. So R2J white-balance applyed onto this
project's video should give an image with constant amount of tint, which
is easy to fix.

# Audio

Dragon Ball Z is all about, just search for it, honestly.

The following table discriminates the audio source of the episodes.
Tokai, Ishikawa and Fuji are the Japanese television channels through
which the audio was first transmitted.

Episodes 100 and 114 are both present in the Tokai and Ishikawa row,
which indicates they are composed of both sources. There are also "next
episode previews" (NEPs) missing from some of these broadcast audios.
Team Mirolo used a filtered version of the Dragon Box audio to fill in
these missing NEPs. These episodes are: 009, 037-039, 052-054, 079-081,
097-099, 128-130, 145-147, 175-176, 190-192, 218-220, 230-232, 256-258,
268-272, and 290.

## Metadata

The single audio track of each episodes have the following properties.

| **Codec** | **Rate** | **Bitdepth** | **Compression** | **Channels** | **Library** |
|:---------:|:--------:|:------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
|  A_FLAC   |  48 kHz  |   16 bits    |    Lossless     |      1       |   libFLAC   |

## Team Mirolo's sync

From their own words:

> The Japanese Dragon Box Z DVDs have their audio tracks badly synced.
> Sound effects appear later than they should. On average, sound effects
> appear 200 ms too late.
>
> In order to video-sync, we had to calculate the gap in milliseconds
> between many video frames and their respective sound effects, for both
> part one and part two of each episode.

![Audio Sync done by Mirolo](img/merge/sfxsync.webp)

The table below shows the
difference in milliseconds to get from the original dragon box audio (or
any audio track in sync with it) to the video-sync. In that table, "Part
A" refers to the first half of the episode, from the beginning to the
end of the first eyecatch. "Part B" refers to the second half, which is
everything after Part A. The "Diff" is simply Part B minus Part A, which
is what needs to be change in Part B in case the fix for Part A is
already applied to the entire episode.

Team Mirolo attaches an updated table with these time shifts to most of
their releases. It is present in this document for the purpose of making
it easy for people to update the synchronization in case Team Mirolo
updates their sync.

# Subtitles

As mentioned in the Aknowledgements section, subtitles in the opening,
ending, and title cards are matching the Japanese kanji present in the
Dragon Boxes.

Our subtitles are based on Steven J. Simmons' translation. It is missing
the translation of Japanese text displayed in the middle of the
episodes.

The episodes for which new subtitles were added to untranslated Japanese
signs or other forms of text are the folowing: 013, 030, 049, 061, 089,
137, 144, 171-172, 186, 195-197, 208-209, 214-215, 218, 223, 243, 249,
and 289-291

The changes in the names and special words took four major factors:
consistency, adaptation, modern and updated *romaji*, and language
origin of the word or the pun indended for the word.
