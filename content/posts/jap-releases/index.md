## Dragon Box

{{< /lead >}}
Beginning in 2003, Toei Animation, in cooperation with the DVD manufacturing company Pony Canyon, began releasing a series of four box sets in Japan covering the entire Dragon Ball TV series property, which were dubbed the “Dragon Boxes”. By mid-2005, all three TV series had been released, although out of chronological order, which marked the first time that any of these properties were available on a home video format in Japan.  In 2006 Toei Animation dropped Pony Canyon and released all of the Dragon Ball movie properties in the fifth and final Dragon Box.
- **Pros:** The film was scanned well much clean-up was done, and the DBOX remains as the only consistent release of the entire classic Dragon Ball franchise that retains proper detail and film grain. All major elements of the Japanese version of the show are retained. Everything is presented in their originally intended aspect ratios with minimal cropping.
- **Cons:** The colors of the film had begun to degrade and no attempt at color correction was made, resulting in inconsistent colors and tints throughout the episodes. ED and NEPs were switched around from original broadcast order. Some would argue the movies being cropped to 16:9 removes part of the image. Audio is muffled for the series and led to the popular perception that DB aired with muffled audio, until Broadcast Audio proved otherwise.


## Movies - Laserdisc Release

DBZ Movies 1-13

Before the Dragon Boxes, the DBZ movies were released on laserdisc in the mid 90s. Since laserdisc audio suffers from less compression than DVD audio, this release has better audio for the movies than the Dragon Box did (although unlike the series, the DBOX audio for the movies was not muffled). The laserdiscs contained analog and digital tracks, with the analog track having a separate channel for the film score. The video on the laserdiscs is lower quality than the DBOX video as they were made pre-restoration, and is cropped to 16:9 just like the Dragon Boxes.

## Movies - VHS Release
The movies were also released on VHS - some of these were left in the full frame 4:3 aspect ratio.

## Movies and Specials - 2018 Toei Remaster

In 2018 all classic Dragon Ball films and specials were once again rescanned and cleaned for their re-release in HD. Unlike anything FUNi has done, the scan was done competently and all the movies have far more detail than in any previous release. Audio appears to have been ported over from the Laserdisc release. But this wouldn't be Dragon Ball if it weren't for complications.

### Amazon H.264 WEB-DLs

The movies were first released on streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon, however Amazon's releases are the ones that are readily available. These versions of the films retain grain, however suffer from the standard issues with streaming sources, such as low bitrate, sometimes crushed details, and Amazon's H.264 encoders having built-in DNR. The original versions of the movies also inexplicably had muffled audio that is worse quality than what was on the Dragon Box sets.

### Amazon H.265 WEB-DLs

It was discovered in 2021 that Amazon updated their streaming masters with new H.265 encodes. While normally this would result in a lower quality bitstarved experience, it was discovered that due to the lack of DNR, most of these movies are now better quality than the H.264 versions. Unfortunately some blocking exists in various scenes.

### Blu-ray Box Set

The movies were all released in a box set soon after they appeared on streaming services. While the BDs have much higher bitrate and clarity, most of the films suffer from a liberal application of DNR that makes them lower quality than the WEB-DLs. However, a popular misconception that ALL the movies have liberal DNR is false. The following films look better on BD than the WEB-DLs: Z Movies 1-4, 8, and 12

### TV Specials - Blu-ray Releases

Z TV Specials 1 and 2

While not released officially in Japan, the Toei Remastered Z TV Specials were aired on TV and streaming services and have been distributed to other countries, including Germany, France, and Spain. At the time of this writing the German Blu-Ray remains the best quality version of these specials. Like with the movies the TV Specials do suffer from minor DNR and some black crush, however they are still very well preserved in their native 4:3 aspect ratio and have decent detail gain over the DBOX versions.

## Modern series and movies

The two modern DB shows, Kai and Super, along with the modern Dragon Ball films, have both been released on DVD and Blu-Ray in Japan. Like most modern shows the releases for these series are fairly straightforward and in general represent the series in their highest quality.

### Dragon Ball Kai Singles DVDs
The series was released on DVD in singles format as the show was airing on TV. Like the TV airing, the DVDs are presented in cropped 16:9 widescreen format. Due to the plagiarism issue surrounding music composer Kenji Yamamoto, the last episode to feature his score on DVD was episode 72. In 2014 the DVDs were re-released in two box sets, this time featuring the replacement score by original series composer Shunsuke Kikuchi for all 98 episodes.

### Dragon Ball Kai Blu-ray box sets
The series was concurrently released on Blu-Ray, however unlike the DVDs the show was presented in Z's original 4:3 aspect ratio. Video wise the BDs are identical in color to the DVDs, although the upgrade in detail is minimal due to the poor overall scan of Kai's footage. Unlike the DVDs the Yamamoto score was kept until episode 76. Like with the DVDs the BDs were re-released in 2 larger box sets with the entire score replaced by Kikuchi.

### Dragon Ball Kai: The Final Chapters (2014) DVD/BD box sets
The 2014 continuation of DB Kai suffers from a wide variety of video problems, however from a release standpoint the show was released as-is on both DVD an Blu-Ray concurrently. This version of the show is the shorter, Japanese version of the Boo Kai arc, which was made specifically for the Japanese market.

### Dragon Ball Super DVD/BD box sets
Dragon Ball Super's Blu-Ray and DVDs present the show as it aired on TV, with some animation improvements in a few episodes. The only other difference is that broadcast episodes 109 and 110, which were broadcast together as a one hour special, have a few shots removed on the home media versions.

### Dragon Ball modern films DVD/BD releases
DBZ Battle of Gods, Resurrection F, and DB Super Broly all received DVD and Blu-Ray releases with no known changes from the original theatrical releases. Each movie has a standard and limited edition box available. Notably, the special "Future Trunks" Edition of Resurrection F has never received a home media release, and the Japanese release of Super Broly does NOT have the green tint that plagues other region's releases.
