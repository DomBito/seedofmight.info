The purpose of this guide is to give you a brief rundown of the various official English releases of Dragon Ball material.

*Note: all officially licensed and released Dragon Ball products in the US since 1995 are produced by FUNimation, regardless of the company doing the dub. Dubs are referred to by their dubbing studio for ease of distinction.

# Main Series

## Dragon Ball - 1995 BLT/Ocean Dub
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-13, Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
Censored version of the first 13 episodes of the show released by BLT in syndication. Contains a replacement score done by Peter Berring and voices provided by Ocean Group. Aired on TV in 1995.
- **Pros:** Decently acted.
- **Cons:** Censored and edited, inconsistent script based on earlier Harmony Gold scripts.

### BLT/KidMark VHS Release
Released on VHS in 1996-1997. The VHS have an early form of home pseudo-surround sound.

### BLT/KidMark DVD Release ("The Saga of Goku")
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-13, Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
Released on DVD in 2000 by KidMark/Trimark.
DVDs have serious compression issues, but have an early form of home pseudo-surround sound.

## Dragon Ball - 2001-2004 FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 153 Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
FUNi's in-house dub of DB started over with episode 1, but due to the rights for the first 13 episodes being held "indefinitely" by Trimark, they could only release 14+ on home video in America. Contains the original Kikuchi score. Aired edited on TV (including 1-13) on Toonami.
- **Pros:** consistent FUNi voice cast, no replacement score, script is generally decent compared to Z.
- **Cons:** despite a decent script, still has many mistranslations and typical FUNi "punched up" dialogue. Some insert songs are removed.

### VHS Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 14-51, 55-86
{{< /lead >}}
The dub was given an incomplete release in edited and uncut forms on VHS from 2001-2004.

### R1 Saga Sets
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 14-153
{{< /lead >}}
The series was released visually uncut on DVD in Saga Set form (7 episodes per disc) in 2003, with the exception of the first 13 episodes.
The release has decent quality, good colors, but major compression artifacts due to the number of episodes on the disc, there's no uncut release for 1-13, and the series is missing OP 2 and ED 1, 3, and 4, all NEPs.

### R4 Saga Sets
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
Same as above, but released in R4 (Australia/NZ) by Madman Entertainment. Notable for containing 1-13 of the FUNi dub uncut, a slight quality bump above the R1 sets, however there is serious frame-blending due to PAL conversion, and one of the Baba discs has an authoring error.
Note: MangaUK released a set in the UK with identical contents but in yellow boxes (Yellow Bricks)

## Dragon Ball Z - 1996-1998 Saban/Ocean Dub
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-67, edited down to 53 episodes, Movie 3
{{< /lead >}}
After giving up on Dragon Ball, FUNi partnered with Saban Entertainment (aka the Power Rangers guys) to syndicate two seasons worth of Dragon Ball Z, again outsourcing the voice acting to Ocean Group. To fit within the standard "season" order, the first 35 episodes were edited and condensed to 26, and then next 32 were cut down to 27. In addition, DBZ movie 3 ("Tree of Might") was dubbed and divided into 3 separate episodes that aired during the second season. This dub features a replacement score done by Ron Wasserman.
- **Pros:** Some iconic voices and character interpretations, a general sense of 90s nostalgia.
- **Cons:** The dub is fairly heavily censored, with most blood and heavy violence edited out, and many, MANY questionable dialogue choices done due to censorship and... the 90s.

### VHS Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-53 edited
{{< /lead >}}
Pioneer handled the home release of the Saban/Ocean dub, and released the series on VHS between 1997 and 1998.

### R1 DVD Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-53 edited
{{< /lead >}}
Same release as above. The R1 singles notably are missing recaps and NEPs. Note that none of these DVDs have the Japanese version of the show.

### R4 DVD Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-53 edited
{{< /lead >}}
Madman's R4 release is notable for having the missing recaps and NEPs, however as with all R4 DVDs has frameblending due to PAL conversion.

### "Rock The Dragon" Box Set
{{< lead >}}
Episoded 1-53 edited, Movies 1-3 edited
{{< /lead >}}
In 2013 FUNi jumped on the nostalgia train and re-released the entire Saban/Ocean dub in one box set, including edited versions of movies 1-3 on DVD for the first time (although movies 1 and 2 were done with Pioneer instead of Saban, and movie 3 is presented in movie form and not the 3-episode version). Unlike the previous Pioneer singles, the RTD set contains all of the recaps and NEPs (except for episode 10). Unfortunately the quality of the episodes is noticeably reduced due to the number of episodes on a disc.

## Dragon Ball Z - 1999-2003 Original FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 68-291, edited down to 54-276
{{< /lead >}}
Following a renewed interest in the show after airing the Saban/Ocean dub on Toonami, FUNimation decided to save costs and move production of the dub entirely in-house for the remainder of the show. The show was dubbed in batches distributed to Toonami as "seasons" (season 3: 54-92, season 4: 93-179, season 5: 180-222, season 6: 223-261, season 7: 262-276). Dale Kelly narrates episodes 54-179, while Kyle Hebert narrates 180-276. The dub features a replacement score done by Faulconer Productions, primarily Mike Smith, Scott Morgan, and Julius Dobos.
- **Pros:** It's visually uncut and is arguably the most well known dub. Later seasons are dubbed decently.
- **Cons:** It's painfully obvious FUNi had no idea what they were doing with season 3, which suffers dramatically in quality compared to the Saban/Ocean dub and FUNi's own later work. The Faulconer Productions score is highly divisive among the fandom. The scripts vary wildly in their accuracy.

### R1 VHS Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 68-291 uncut, 54-276 edited, excluding 4 volumes of the Cell Games
{{< /lead >}}
These are technically considered a direct continuation of the earlier Pioneer singles, and were released in edited and uncut format between 1999 and 2003. The VHS contain all recaps beginning with the Freeza episodes, but only feature a NEP at the end of each tape. FUNimation replaced narrator Dale Kelly with Kyle Hebert during the release of these episodes, as a result some of the Cell Games narration has been redubbed. The Uncut VHS replaces Kelly with Hebert for closing narration only for 157-159, and completely after 160. The EDITED VHS is more complicated, replacing him in recaps for 161, 162, and permanently after 164, and in closing narration and NEPs starting with 166.

### R1 DVD Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 68-291 uncut, 54-276 edited
{{< /lead >}}
These are technically considered a direct continuation of the earlier Pioneer singles. For the first time, the DVDs are dual-audio and contain the Japanese version. Due to FUNi slowly figuring out how to do proper releases, these DVD vary wildly with regards to authoring and what they contain. The two Ginyu DVDs are missing recaps on all episodes. Freeza-Androids episodes are missing the eyecatches, and occassionally have entire shots deleted from before or after the eyecatch. Some Freeza and the Trunks DVDs were re-issued with eyecatches and restored material. The second Trunks volume also has two versions, one with 3 episodes and one with 5, that were released at different times.
FUNimation replaced narrator Dale Kelly with Kyle Hebert during the release of these episodes, as a result some of the Cell Games narration has been redubbed. The DVDs replace Kelly with Hebert for closing narration only for 157-159, and completely after 160.
In general the DVDs have decent colors but suffer from compression artifacts and limited detail compared to R2J sources.

### R4 DVD Singles
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 68-291 uncut, 54-276 edited
{{< /lead >}}
Same release as above, but with a few key differences. Only the dub is included up until the Boo episodes. The Ginyu episodes have recaps AND NEPs for the first and last episodes of the discs respectively. Recaps in general are only included on the first episode of each disc. As typical with R4 releases, the episodes have frame blending due to PAL conversion.

## Dragon Ball Z - 2005 Ultimate Uncut Dub
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-67
{{< /lead >}}
Following the completion of dubbing Dragon Ball GT, FUNimation decided to go back and redub the first 67 episodes that had originally been released in an edited format. Despite being advertised as uncut, much of the dialogue was lifted straight from the earlier Saban/Ocean scripts, albeit most of the more egregious lines were retranslated. This dub aired in its entirety on Cartoon Network and Toonami in 2005, and features a replacement score by Nathan Johnson.
- **Pros:** First 67 episodes finally uncut, scenes previous cut had relatively accurate scripts, fairly decent acting performances.
- **Cons:** OP is fairly dated, Johnson's music is fairly mediocre, reused scripts, incomplete release (see below)

### Ultimate Uncut Edition DVDs (UUEs)
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-27
{{< /lead >}}
The episodes were released on DVD in 2005 and 2006 following a similar format to previous singles releases. This is the last FUNi release of Z to use their original DigiBeta masters. This release is also unique in that it features the Latin America (LATAM) Spanish dub of DBZ as a third audio track, as well as the only 5.1 version of any replacement score. Due to various reasons but mostly because nobody wanted to buy 3-episodes-per-disc releases anymore, the UUE line was cancelled abruptly after episode 27.

## Dragon Ball Z - 2007-2009 Remastered Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 291 Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
After the UUEs were cancelled it was announced that FUNi would release the entire series in larger, season-based batches, starting again from episode 1 and continuing in its entirely until the end of the series for the first time. As part of this new release, FUNi revised parts of their previous in-house dub by having certain actors redub lines for continuity and performance. While the recently completed UUE dub was mostly left unchanged, about half of the performances of the original season 3 dub were redubbed, albeit inconsistently. There were fewer changes for season 4+, however significant examples of changes in actors, dialogue, music, and even sound effects exist across the entire series, enough for some people to consider this a completely different dub product. While the previously created replacement scores by Nathan Johnson and Faulconer Productions were left mostly intact, a version of the dub was also created with the original Shunsuke Kikuchi score in 5.1 surround sound. The OP and EP themes created by GT and movie composer Mark Menza replaced eariler compositions.
- **Pros:** The whole series done with one consistent voice cast, the availability of the original music score with an English dub, generally improved performances in redubbed material
- **Cons:** generally inconsistent redubbed efforts, many problematic lines left untouched, poor sound mixing which left all voice filters and effects removed and several Faulconer Productions cues replaced

### Remastered Box Sets (Orange Bricks)
{{< lead >}}
All episodes
{{< /lead >}}
FUNimation rescanned their film print of DBZ and scanned and cleaned the film in HD, however the episodes were scanned in at the cropped ratio of 16:9 and FUNi decided to "remaster" the video further by adding a bunch of filters and other processing to basically create a "clean", over-exposed mess. FUNi then divided the series into a set of 9 arbitrary "seasons" that don't match the actual seasons as aired on Toonami and released the sets between 2007 and 2009. Nevertheless, this release was the first and only way to buy the complete series with all Japanese elements intact (except NEPs) and both versions of the new remastered dub, and because each release was incredibly cheap, it sold extremely well.

### R1 Dragon Box Sets
{{< lead >}}
All episodes
{{< /lead >}}
Literally two months after the completion of the Orange Bricks, FUNimation announced it was releasing the entire series on DVD again, but this time was importing the 2003 Dragon Box master from Japan. Instead of being released in two giant boxes, the FUNi Dragon Box was divided arbitrarily into 7 smaller boxes, and released between 2009 and 2011. The video is basically the same as the R2J Dragon Box, although there are minor encoding, contrast, grain, and crop differences. The Dragon Box also notably contained only the 5.1 English/Kikuchi dub track, eliminating the replacement score entirely, likely because FUNi wanted to move away from using and marketing replacement scores. The English 5.1 track is also the only release to have the proper Japanese OPs (other sets use Menza's OP) and is the only American release to contain all NEPs (visually, there are no English NEPs on this or any other post-singles release).

### Blu-ray Level Sets
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-39*
{{< /lead >}}
Before the last Dragon Box was released, and while FUNi was working on DBZ Kai, FUNi announced in 2011 that they were AGAIN going to remaster and re-release the series, this time on Blu-Ray, but instead of releasing in large chunks, the sets were scaled back to smaller batches of 17 episodes each, at a relatively high price point. Despite the work done for the Orange Bricks, FUNi's new remaster was allegedly done frame-by-frame, with additional adjustments to color and contrast, while leaving the aspect ratio in its natural 4:3 format. The end result was a beautiful HD transfer of the show, and thus naturally it was cancelled after two releases and 34 episodes due to "low sales". Note that episodes 35-39 were released on streaming services. Also note that the Level Sets revert to containing the replacement score track along with the Kikuchi score.

### Blu-ray Box Sets (Season Sets)
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
FUNi's takeaway from the "failure" of the Level Sets was that people didn't want the show in 4:3, and so they started over one more time, taking the scan done for the Levels, cropping it again to 16:9, and applying Orange Brick style DNR, filtering, and processing to all episodes. The Season Sets followed the same "season" breakdown as the Orange Bricks, and were once again released at a cheaper price point from 2013-2015, and naturally this release sold incredibly well as a result. The remastered dub with replacement score was also remixed from scratch, resulting in even more changes and adjustments to music placements, dialogue, and sound effects compared to the Orange Bricks. Nevertheless this release contains probably the best sound quality for the English dub.

### Blu-ray 30TH Anniversary Box Set (30A)
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
It's the exact same thing as above, but in 4:3, with additional fake grain, worse colors, and costs $1000 on ebay. They have since been repackaged as steelbooks.

### Dragon Ball GT - 2003-2005 FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 64* Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
Following the completion of Dragon Ball Z, FUNimation moved to dubbing its sequel series. Hoping to bring in fans who would have otherwise shied away from GT due to its reputation as a sub-par series, FUNi instead went all out in attempting to bring in the "hardcore" DBZ fanbase, creating an edgy marketing campaign that famously asked fans if "You Think You Know GT". FUNi deleted the more whimsical, DB-like first 16 episodes, instead creating a summary clip show, created a "celebrated" new OP asking fans to "Step Into The Grand Tour", and brought in Mark Menza to do a hip-hop based replacement score. Following the intial run, FUNi went back and dubbed and released the cut episodes as "The Lost Episodes".
- **Pros:** With the lost episodes, the series was released completely with one voice cast.
- **Cons:** It's still DBGT. The Menza score, specifically the OP, is incredibly divisive.

### VHS Release
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
These episodes were released is a similar format to other VHS releases, in edited and uncut forms. As mentioned above, episodes 17-64 were released first, with the "Lost Episodes" released at the end of the run.

### R1 DVD Singles
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
These episodes were released is a similar format to other singles releases. As mentioned above, episodes 17-64 were released first, with the "Lost Episodes" released at the end of the run. This release notably contains NEPs for every episode. These episodes were released in 3 box sets in 2007.

R1 Remastered Box Sets (Green Bricks)
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes, SP
{{< /lead >}}
FUNi put their DBGT DigiBetas through their "remastering" process, although unlike with Z they left the aspect ratio in 4:3 and generally did not completely destroy the video quality although the release still has DNR. Like the Z Orange Bricks, this release features a new English track with the original Tokunaga score in 5.1 surround sound, as well as new English dubbed OPs and EDs, in addition to the Menza score. Unfortunately, all NEPs have been removed, because even GT fans can't have nice things.

## Dragon Ball (Z) Kai - 2010-2012 FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 98 Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
This was a new, "manga-accurate" (it's not) recut of Dragon Ball Z created by Toei, which included a complete redub by the Japanese actors and a "remastered" film scan of DBZ done by Q-Tec. While the colors and DNR application were generally praised, the entire scan suffers from a "bluriness" as a result of being scanned mostly out-of-focus. For various debatable reasons, several shots of each episode were traced and poorly re-animated, further degrading the orignal animation. For their part, FUNimation decided to use this new, "manga-accurate" cut of Z to actually put effort into properly translating a Dragon Ball dub. As such the FUNi dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai contains a script that is (MOSTLY) true to the original intention of the show, with fairly strong performances from their now seasoned voice actors. The dub originally premiered on Nicktoons in a slightly edited format with many replacement lines, however all American releases keep the original Japanese scores.
Of course this wouldn't be an American Dragon Ball release without controversy, and thus as the series was about halfway released in America (with only 3 episodes remaining in Japan), Japanese music composer Kenji Yamamoto was fired for plagiarism, creating a score vacancy that was filled with a limited selection of Z composer Shunsuke Kikuchi's work.
- **Pros:** Brand new English dub, somewhat decent remastering process, quicker pace and reduced filler
- **Cons:** Poorly animated re-drawn scenes, accusation of FUNi making the lines "too close" to the original (??), some different English VAs generate strong opinions, music scandal led to an inconsistent score, lots of filler still left in.

### DVD/Blu-ray "Parts" Release, Yamammoto Score
{{< lead >}}
Episodes 1-52
{{< /lead >}}
FUNimation's transfer of DBZ Kai is visually identical to its Japanese counterpart, with the exception of English text for OPs, titles, and EDs. Each "Part" consists of 13 episodes, a format somewhat reminiscent of the Level Sets. Due to the plagiarism issue, these are now out of print.

### DVD/Blu-ray "Parts" Release, Kikuchi Score
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
The plagiarism scandal occured between the release of the 4th and 5th parts, thus beginning with Part 5 (episode 53), all FUNi releases of Kai use the Kikuchi replacement score. In addition, parts 1-4 were re-released in 2012 with the Kikuchi score as well, thus creating two versions of those releases. There are 8 parts in total.

### DVD/Blu-ray "Season" Release
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
The above episodes were packaged together into 4 larger releases at a lower price point, dubbed "seasons". All discs are identical to the ones in the Kikuchi Parts release. Apparently R2 (UK) received the earlier parts released packaged as seasons so some versions of the first two seasons have Yamamoto instead of Kikuchi

## Dragon Ball (Z) Kai: The Final Chapters - 2014 FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 69 Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
Due to international demand, Toei created a half-assed continuation of DB Kai for the Boo arc of Z. Unlike Kai 1.0, Toei did the remastering themselves, which on the plus side meant no more terrible re-drawn scenes, but on the negative meant that the whole thing was cropped to 16:9 to meet Japanese broadcast standards, and the show was blessed with the now-standard Toei "green tint". To get around the plagiarism issue Toei hired Norihito Sumitomo to do a new score. FUNi dubbed the international version of the series soon after it was released in 2014, however it was not released in America until 2017. The dub features a 5.1 surround score and the original score by Norihito Sumitomo. Unlike Kai 1.0, the script is less accurate and some of the performances are notably more restrained than the now 15 year old Z dub.
- **Pros:** A complete Kai experience exists.
- **Cons:** It's cropped and green.

### DVD/Blu-ray "Parts" Release
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
Kai TFC was released in 3 "parts" releases in 2017, although in practice they resemble the Kai "season" releases more. The American release contains just as much crop and green tint as the Japanese release, however TFC overall has less sharpening than Japanese Boo Kai. Note that while the DVDs have the same number of episodes per part, the episodes are distributed on 4 discs instead of 3.

## Dragon Ball Super - 2017-2020 FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
All 131 Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
FUNimation dubbed DBS using similar methodologies as their TFC dub, so it's mostly accurate with some deviations. There are no other major visual differences between the American and Japanese releases, outside of English text. The dub features a 5.1 surround score and the original score by Norihito Sumitomo.
- **Pros:** More Dragon Ball!
- **Cons:** It's Super.

### Blu-ray "Parts" Release
{{< lead >}}
All Episodes
{{< /lead >}}
The methodology here is similar to other "Parts" releases. Why FUNi can't do this with DBZ, idk.

# Movies and Specials

## 1996 BLT/Ocean Dub
{{< lead >}}
DB Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
The dub for Movie 1 was done at the same time as the first 13 episodes, and appears to be based in part on the script done for the earlier Harmony Gold dub. The film is edited for content and has a few scenes of episodes from DB spliced in, and has a replacement score by Peter Berring.

### VHS Release
{{< lead >}}
DB Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
The movie was released by itself in 1996 by KidMark. It features the same pseudo-surround sound that the series has.

### DVD Release
{{< lead >}}
DB Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
The movie was released on the second disc of the "Saga of Goku" DVD release of the complete BLT dub in 2000. It features the same pseudo-surround sound that the series has.

## 1997-1998 Pioneer/Ocean Dub
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1-3
{{< /lead >}}
FUNimation outsourced the dubbing and distribution of its first 3 movie dubs to Pioneer, who then hired the same Ocean cast that at that point had just finished the season 2 dub. This dub is notable for being incredibly faithful to the Japanese version of the films, with minimal dialogue changes while retaining the original Shunsuke Kikuchi score, including the insert songs in movies 1 and 2. All films are presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Note that the movies were released out of order (1, 3, 2). Also note that there is another censored and edited version of movie 3 done with the Ocean cast that was released under Saban.

### VHS Release
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1-3
{{< /lead >}}
The dub was released uncut on VHS. Also note that a subbed version was also released on VHS.

### LASERDISC Release
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1-3
{{< /lead >}}
The dub was also released uncut on Laserdisc. These are the only American laserdisc releases of any DB content.

### DVD Singles Release
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1-3
{{< /lead >}}
The DVDs were released as dual-audio, a first in the US, containing both Japanese and English versions. These movies were released together in a box set in 2001.

### "Rock The Dragon" Boxset
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1 and 2, edited
{{< /lead >}}
As part of FUNimation's nostalgia-based RTD release, edited versions of the first 3 movies appear on the final disc. While movies 1 and 2 are TV-edited versions of the Pioneer films, movie 3 is replaced with the Saban/Ocean edited version. No edited version of Pioneer movie 3 exists.

## 2000-2006 Original FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
DB Movies 2-4, DBZ Movies 1-13, Z Specials 1 and 2, GT Special
{{< /lead >}}
When FUNimation brought their dub in-house for DBZ, they began working on movies where the Pioneer films left off, although it appears that they decided to test the feasibility of working in-house with their dub of DB Movie 2, which was possibly done during the same time period as the Pioneer Z movies, although not released on VHS until 2000. FUNi next worked on the two Z specials and DB movie 3 before resuming the Z movies where Pioneer left off with Movie 4. Between 2001 and 2006, FUNi dubbed and released the remaining Z movies, including redubbed and less accurate versions of the first 3 Z movies, as well as DB Movie 4 and the GT special. Unlike the Pioneer films, FUNi's scripts were much less accurate, and the Kikuchi music in the Z films and specials was replaced by various bands and music from composers Mark Menza and Nathan Johnson. All films are presented in 4:3 aspect ratio.

### VHS Singles Release
{{< lead >}}
DB Movies 2-4, DBZ Movies 4-10, Z Specials 1 and 2
{{< /lead >}}
Edited and uncut versions of the FUNi films were released on VHS as late as 2005.

### DVD Singles Release
{{< lead >}}
DB Movies 3 and 4, DBZ Movies 1, 4-13, Z Specials 1 and 2, GT Special
{{< /lead >}}
Note that there are edited DVDs for the DB movies and Z movies 4-9. The DVDs are typical of FUNi's singles releases during this time period and are for the most part dual-audio. DBZ Movie 5 also has the LATAM Spanish dub. all DB movies and all Z movies and specials except 4 feature a 5.1 replacement score track. Movies 4-6 and movies 8, 10, and 11 were all later collected into box sets with identical discs.

## 2007-2011 Remastered FUNimation Dub
{{< lead >}}
DB Movies 1-4, DBZ Movies 1-13, Z Specials 1 and 2, GT Special
{{< /lead >}}
FUNimation used the same methods that they used for "remastering" the series on the movies and specials, and this included doing light re-dubbing and remixing of sound elements, although not to the same extent as what was done with Z. All movies received a new 5.1 track with original score by Shunsuke Kikuchi (and Tokunaga in the GT special). DB Movie 1 was finally dubbed for the first time by FUNimation's in-house cast in 2011. In addition, all Z movies (and specials, unfortunately) were presented in cropped 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Broly Test Blu-ray Release
Z Movies 8 an 10 were released together as a test release, featuring all elements above.

### Burst Limit PS3 Bonus Blu-ray
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movie 1
{{< /lead >}}
Dead Zone was released as a special dub-only Blu-Ray that came with the PS3 version of Burst Limit.

### DVD/Blu-ray Double-feature Releases
{{< lead >}}
DBZ Movies 1-13, Z Specials 1 and 2
{{< /lead >}}
All Z Movies and the two specials were paired together in sequential order and released as double-features (with the exceptions of 7 and 9, and 8, 10 and 11). DVDs were released in steelbooks, while Blu-Rays were released is standard Blu-Ray covers. Note that the DVDs have been re-packaged several times, first in 3 collections and then in one complete collection. All content is identical, only the packaging is different.

### Remastered Dragon Ball GT Box Sets (Green Bricks)
{{< lead >}}
DBGT Special
{{< /lead >}}
The remastered version of the GT Special is included with the rest of DBGT in the Green Bricks.

### Dragon Ball Movie 4-Pack
{{< lead >}}
DB Movies 1-4
{{< /lead >}}
The four Dragon Ball movies, including the newly dubbed Movie 1, were released together in a 4-pack release in 2011. The dubs for movies 2-4 are untouched, however, resulting in 3 different actors playing Goku across the 4 movies and wildly different recording and script quality. This remaster was also released in HD on streaming platforms and actually got a physical Blu-Ray release in Mexico by Zima, however with no English dub. Note that movie 2's film was scanned in at 12 fps, resulting in frame rate issues, and despite being an obvious problem has not been corrected on any release. Note that unlike the Z films, these remain in 4:3.
